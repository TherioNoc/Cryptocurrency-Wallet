# Cryptocurrency Wallet


Before using ```cryptowallet.py```, you need install required libraries from ```libraries.py```


Make sure that all three files ```cryptographic_functions.py, wallet.py, transaction.py``` are in the same directory when running the ```cryptowallet.py``` Python script that uses the wallet and transaction functionality.
